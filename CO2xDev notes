CO2xDev notes

Andrew asked to see some new tables for which I was sloppy on the JMP laptop in keeping everything tidy. 
I have a new data file that I THINK includes all of the data that I want.
The problem comes from the Kmeans clustering. It converts all of the LSMEAN values into numbers that do not make sense outside of the LSMEANS context. I found a file dated Sept 20 2012 that has all of the REAL lsmeans and the linear ones..prior to KMEANS clustering.

I made a copy of this file and put it in the development repository.
